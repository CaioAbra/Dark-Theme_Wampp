<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many excellent Theme templates available; however, I didn't find one that really did what I wanted, so I created this one with what I was looking for. I want to create a wampp theme so awesome that it's the last one you'll ever need -- I think that's it.

Here's why:
* Beautiful
* Light
* doesn't get tired as fast as standards :smile:

Of course, the theme will not suit or please everyone, since everyone has a taste!
